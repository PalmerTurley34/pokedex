# pokedex

Pokedex project for learning Go

This is a simple command line application that interacts with the [pokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
Using this application you can page through all
the location areas from the pokemon games. You can explore areas to see which pokemon can be found and try to catch the pokemon to add to you pokedex.

This cli app is written in Go, and is a good exercise in consuming REST APIs, goroutines, caching and more.
